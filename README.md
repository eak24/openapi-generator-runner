# openapi-generator-runner

Deterministically build, test and deploy openapi-generator generators defined within the openapi spec.

By defining an `x-openapi-generator-runner` extension object in the `info` section of an `OpenApi` specification, you
can now easily manage generation, testing and deployment of resulting clients.
